Very simple shell script that creates five directories: VIDEOS, PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS, DATA, and DISK IMAGES.

The script then moves all files, based on file extension, into the appropriate directory. Additional directories and file extensions can easily be added in a fork to suit your needs.

Designed for use with MacOS system.
